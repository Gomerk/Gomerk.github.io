	<strong>H1Z1 KOTK (King Of The Kill) is a massivly multiplayer first person shooter. The objective is to kill everyone in the zone and be the last man standing. There are tons of weapons to choose from ranging from a M9 Pistol to a Ak-47. You are launched into the battlefield with around 170 other players with the sole mission to be the last one to survive. Within this world there are a lot of points of intrest that help you to selecting where you may want to adventure to. These places are usually abandoned towns or cabins or even gas stations. These places you can usually find an abundance of weapons and if you are lucky maybe even a working car that you can use.
